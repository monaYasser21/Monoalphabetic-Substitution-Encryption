The project focuses on building a simple text encryption and decryption system using a substitution table. The program will first construct a mapping table and store it in memory. Once the table is set, the user will be able to:

Input a plain text message – The message is entered without spaces between words.

Encrypt the message – Each character of the plain text is converted into a cipher character using the stored table.

Decrypt the cipher text – The program uses the same table to reverse the substitution and retrieve the original plain text message.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of data storage in memory, character mapping, encryption/decryption algorithms, and string processing.
